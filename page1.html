                    <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/drug-misuse-addiction">The National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> defined drug addiction as a chronic and relapsing condition characterized by the compulsive and uncontrollable use of drugs, despite negative consequences. Drug addiction, also known as substance use order is a complex brain disorder that involves both physical and psychological dependence on a substance. Individuals with drug addiction experience intense cravings for the drug, difficulty controlling their drug use, and may continue using despite adverse health, social, and legal consequences.

                    As of 2020, 50% of American people who are 12 years and older have experimented with illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime (<a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org">NCDAS 2020</a>). Drug abuse and addiction continue to be significant public health concerns worldwide. Drug statistics reveal the widespread impact of substance use on individuals, families, and communities. In the face of these challenges, safe drug education emerges as a crucial strategy to address the issue. By providing accurate information, raising awareness about the risks and consequences of drug use, and promoting harm reduction practices, safe drug education equips individuals with the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions. It empowers individuals to develop critical thinking skills, resist peer pressure, and seek help when needed. Ultimately, safe drug education plays a pivotal role in preventing substance abuse, reducing associated harms, and fostering healthier communities.
